      <p>NBE is the oldest commercial bank in Egypt. It was established on June 25, 1898 with a capital of Â£ 1 million. Throughout its long history, NBE's functions and roles have continually developed to square with the different economic and political stages in Egypt.</p>
      <p>During the 1950s, NBE assumed the central bank's duties. After its nationalization in the 1960s, it acted as a pure commercial bank besides carrying out the functions of the central bank in the areas where the latter had no branches. Moreover, since mid-1960s, NBE has been in charge of issuing and managing investment certificates on behalf of the government.</p>
